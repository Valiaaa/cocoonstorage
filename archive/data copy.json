The design follows a systematic approach‚Äîguided by an underlying grid system and precise margins, which lend a contemporary structure while subtly diverging from classical typographic conventions. Within this structure, each spread is designed to offer moments of visual tension and quiet surprise. The cover introduces a linear motif that echoes the internal grid, extending the system outward while alluding to the passage of time."

Designed as a speculative exercise, the piece imagines an alternative future for digital reading‚Äîwhere pagination remains, but images move, loop, and distort. Natural forms and mechanical remnants collide across each spread: overgrown vehicles, outstretched limbs, and hyperreal parrots unfold in dreamlike rhythm, quietly unsettling the conventions of static editorial space."

The piece blurs the boundary between real and rendered, evoking an eerie familiarity that lingers without resolution, like a place once visited but never fully seen."
